  Hi! Thanks for checking out this website. 
  I made it myself! 
  This website was made by hand. 
  I intentionally haven't minified anything so you can see how it all fits together.

      This is my website! I keep a lot of things here, most of them because I find them interesting,
      or perhaps because I don't want to forget about them. I hope you enjoy browsing this website
      as much as I enjoyed making it.

    <h2>About this website</h2>
    <p>
      This website is pretty simple. Right now, I write the HTML for it by hand - no generators. I'm
      a big fan of
      <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">Motherfucking Website</a> and its counterpart
      <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/"> Better Motherfucking Website</a>. I think
      that the web should be designed around simple, handmade things and believe that I can be a
      part of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website uses <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> and
      <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">Highlight.js</a> to render math and code; however, I intend
      for this site to be readable even without them enabled. Feel free to disable scripts if you
      like.
